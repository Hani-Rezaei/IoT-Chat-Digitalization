This setup uses a single serial interface, ethos (Ethernet Over Serial) and UHCP (micro Host Configuration Protocol) (using DHCPv6 alternatively is also possible). Ethos multiplexes serial data to separate ethernet packets from shell commands. UHCP is in charge of configuring the wireless interface prefix and routes on the BR.

The script {\ttfamily start\+\_\+network.\+sh} enables a {\itshape ready-\/to-\/use} BR in only one command.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Uplink}{Uplink}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md1}
The border router will route packets between a 6Lo network (PAN) and a \textquotesingle{}normal\textquotesingle{} IPv6 network (i.\+e. the Internet).

This requires the border router to have two interfaces\+: A downstream interface to run 6Lo\+WPAN on and an IPv6 uplink.

This example comes with support for three uplink types pre-\/configured\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://doc.riot-os.org/group__drivers__ethos.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily ethos}}} (default)
\item \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1055}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily slip}}}
\item {\ttfamily wifi}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For {\ttfamily native} the host-\/facing \href{https://doc.riot-os.org/netdev__tap_8h.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily netdev\+\_\+tap}}} device is configured, providing connectivity via a TAP interface to the RIOT instance. On the node-\/facing side \href{https://doc.riot-os.org/group__drivers__socket__zep.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily socket\+\_\+zep}}} is used to simulate a IEEE 802.\+15.\+4 network.

To select an uplink, set the UPLINK environment variable. For instance, use {\ttfamily UPLINK=slip} for a SLIP uplink.

{\ttfamily ethos} and {\ttfamily slip} will make use of the existing serial interface that is used for the RIOT shell to provide an upstream interface. Your computer will act as the upstream router, stdio is multiplexed over the same line.

The {\ttfamily wifi} uplink will connect to an existing Wi\+Fi (IEEE 802.\+11) network. The network must provide a DHCPv6 server that supports prefix delegation (IA\+\_\+\+PD) when {\ttfamily PREFIX\+\_\+\+CONF=dhcpv6} is set (default).

Use {\ttfamily WIFI\+\_\+\+SSID="{}\+SSID"{} WIFI\+\_\+\+PASS="{}password"{}} in your {\ttfamily make} command to set your Wi\+Fi\textquotesingle{}s credentials. You can alternatively edit the {\ttfamily Makefile}.

Currently, {\ttfamily wifi} requires an esp8266 or esp32 for the border router and will default to using {\ttfamily esp\+\_\+now} for the downstream interface.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Connection sharing with host}{Connection sharing with host}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md2}
If the host (Linux) computer has an IPv6 uplink that can be shard with the RIOT border router to provide it with an uplink.

This requires the host network to be bridged with the TAP network by connecting it to the TAP bridge\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}sudo dist/tools/tapsetup/tapsetup -u eno1
\end{DoxyVerb}
 where {\ttfamily eno1} is the host\textquotesingle{}s uplink interface.

Then specify {\ttfamily REUSE\+\_\+\+TAP=1} when building / running the border router application. This works with both {\ttfamily native} and the {\ttfamily ethos} uplink.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Requirements}{Requirements}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md3}
This functionality works only on Linux machines.

If you want to use DHCPv6, you also need a DHCPv6 server configured for prefix delegation from the interface facing the border router. With the \href{https://kea.isc.org/}{\texttt{ KEA}} DHCPv6 server e.\+g. you can use the following configuration\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{"{}Dhcp6"{}:}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}interfaces-\/config"{}:\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ "{}interfaces"{}:\ [\ "{}tap0"{}\ ]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ "{}subnet6"{}:\ [}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \{\ \ \ \ "{}interface"{}:\ "{}tap0"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}subnet"{}:\ "{}2001:db8::/16"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}pd-\/pools"{}:\ [\ \{\ "{}prefix"{}:\ "{}2001:db8::"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}prefix-\/len"{}:\ 16,}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}delegated-\/len"{}:\ 64\ \}\ ]\ \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ ...}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Note that when working with TAP interfaces you might need to restart your DHCPv6 server once {\itshape after} you started the border router application (see below), since Linux might not recognize the interface as connected.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Setup}{Setup}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md4}
To compile and flash {\ttfamily gnrc\+\_\+border\+\_\+router} to your board\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make\ clean\ all\ flash}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you want to use DHCPv6 instead of UHCP compile with the environment variable {\ttfamily PREFIX\+\_\+\+CONF} set to dhcpv6


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{PREFIX\_CONF=dhcpv6\ make\ clean\ all\ flash}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md5}
The {\ttfamily start\+\_\+network.\+sh} script needed for {\ttfamily ethos} and {\ttfamily slip} is automatically run if you type


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make\ term}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will execute the needed commands to setup a {\ttfamily tap} ({\ttfamily ethos}) or {\ttfamily tun} ({\ttfamily slip}) interface and configure the BR. Notice that this will also configure {\ttfamily 2001\+:db8\+:\+:/64} as a prefix. This prefix should be announced to other motes through the wireless interface.

As said previously, {\ttfamily ethos} and {\ttfamily slipdev} allow to send IP packets and shell commands. This is done through the same serial interface. By typing {\ttfamily help} you will get the list of available shell commands.

At this point you should be able to ping motes using their global address. For instance, if you use the \href{https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/tree/master/examples/gnrc_networking}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily gnrc\+\_\+networking}}} example on the mote, you can ping it from your machine with\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ ping\ 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1}

\end{DoxyCode}


Just replace this address by your mote\textquotesingle{}s address. Using {\ttfamily ifconfig} on the shell of your mote shows you the addresses of your mote, for instance\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Iface\ \ 7\ \ \ HWaddr:\ 59:72\ \ Channel:\ 26\ \ Page:\ 0\ \ NID:\ 0x23}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Long\ HWaddr:\ 5a:46:10:6e:f2:f5:d9:72}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ TX-\/Power:\ 0dBm\ \ State:\ IDLE\ \ max.\ Retrans.:\ 3\ \ CSMA\ Retries:\ 4}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ AUTOACK\ \ CSMA\ \ MTU:1280\ \ HL:64\ \ 6LO\ \ RTR\ \ RTR\_ADV\ \ IPHC}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Source\ address\ length:\ 8}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Link\ type:\ wireless}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ inet6\ addr:\ ff02::1/128\ \ scope:\ local\ [multicast]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ inet6\ addr:\ fe80::5846:106e:f2f5:d972/64\ \ scope:\ local}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ inet6\ addr:\ ff02::1:fff5:d972/128\ \ scope:\ local\ [multicast]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ inet6\ addr:\ 2001:db8::5846:106e:f2f5:d972/64\ \ scope:\ global}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ inet6\ addr:\ ff02::2/128\ \ scope:\ local\ [multicast]}

\end{DoxyCode}


The script also sets up a ULA (Unique Local Address) address on your Linux {\ttfamily tap0} network interface. You can check your ULA on your PC with {\ttfamily ifconfig} Linux command. On this example, such address can be pinged from 6lo motes\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ ping\ fd00:dead:beef::1}

\end{DoxyCode}


Thus far, IPv6 communication with between your PC and your motes is enabled.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Simulated network with native}{Simulated network with native}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md6}
On native a IEEE 802.\+15.\+4 network is simulated by encapsulating 802.\+15.\+4 frames inside UDP packets. For this the {\ttfamily socket\+\_\+zep} modules is used both on the border router and on the virtual mote.

The UDP packets are sent to a dispatcher which forwards them to all other nodes. By default a simple dispatcher is provided that will forward every packet to every node (perfect broadcast), but it can be replaced by the user with alternative dispatchers to simulate more advanced topologies.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{gnrc\+\_\+border\+\_\+router with manual config}{gnrc\_border\_router with manual config}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md7}
You can use {\ttfamily ethos} as a standalone driver, if you want to setup the BR manually.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Setup}{Setup}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md8}
To select ethos as the serial driver, be sure that the {\ttfamily Makefile} has the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ifeq\ (,\$(filter\ native\ native64,\$(BOARD)))}
\DoxyCodeLine{USEMODULE\ +=\ stdio\_ethos}
\DoxyCodeLine{CFLAGS\ +=\ '-\/DETHOS\_UART=UART\_DEV(0)'\ -\/DETHOS\_BAUDRATE=115200}
\DoxyCodeLine{FEATURES\_REQUIRED\ +=\ periph\_uart}
\DoxyCodeLine{endif}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#\ include\ UHCP\ client}
\DoxyCodeLine{USEMODULE\ +=\ gnrc\_uhcpc}

\end{DoxyCode}


You\textquotesingle{}ll need IPv6 access to the nodes attached to the BR from your Linux PC. To do this, it is necessary to add a {\ttfamily tap} interface. As an example, you can do it as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ tuntap\ add\ tap0\ mode\ tap\ user\ \$\{USER\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will setup your {\ttfamily tap} interface. Then configure it to route the packets coming from your 6lo network\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ link\ set\ tap0\ up}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ a\ a\ 2001:db8::1/48\ dev\ tap0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ r\ d\ 2001:db8::/48\ dev\ tap0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ r\ a\ 2001:db8::2\ dev\ tap0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ip\ r\ a\ 2001:db8::/48\ via\ 2001:db8::2\ dev\ tap0}

\end{DoxyCode}


Please note that the prefix {\ttfamily 2001\+:db8\+:\+:} is used as an example.

Then you can flash the {\ttfamily gnrc\+\_\+border\+\_\+router} example on your board\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make\ clean\ all\ flash}

\end{DoxyCode}


On this RIOT BR two interfaces are present. A wired interface represents the serial link between Linux and your mote. A wireless interface represents the 802.\+15.\+4 radio link. In order to route packets between this two interfaces, you can do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ ifconfig\ 6\ add\ 2001:db8::2/48}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ ifconfig\ 5\ add\ 2001:db8::3/64}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ fibroute\ add\ ::\ via\ <link-\/local\ of\ tap>\ dev\ 6}

\end{DoxyCode}


By adding the address to the wireless interface the prefix will be disseminated. This prefix will be automatically added by the motes in the radio range.\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md9}
Run ethos by choosing a serial interface according to your board. For instance {\ttfamily /dev/tty\+USB\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}} or {\ttfamily /dev/tty\+ACM\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ./ethos\ tap0\ /dev/ttyACM0}

\end{DoxyCode}


Now, you should be able to ping your nodes. Use the global address starting by your prefix, on our case {\ttfamily 2001\+:db8\+:\+:}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{>\ ping\ 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1}

\end{DoxyCode}

In order to setup a 6Lo\+WPAN border router on RIOT, you need either a board that offers an IPv6 capable network interface (e.\+g. the {\ttfamily encx24j600} Ethernet chip) or connect it over the serial interface to a Linux host and use the SLIP standard \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}. The example application in this folder assumes as a default to be run on an Atmel SAM R21 Xplained Pro evaluation board using an external UART adapter for the second serial interface. However, it is feasible to run the example on any RIOT supported platform that offers either more than one UART or be equipped with an IPv6 capable network device. In this case only the Makefile.\+board.\+dep of this application has to be slightly modified, e.\+g. by replacing the line 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{USEMODULE\ +=\ ethos}

\end{DoxyCode}
 with something like 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{USEMODULE\ +=\ encx24j600}

\end{DoxyCode}
 and specify the target platform as {\ttfamily BOARD = myplatform}.

Be sure that you have replaced on your {\ttfamily Makefile} the lines to use SLIP. You should have something like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{UPLINK\ ?=\ slip}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Configuration}{Configuration}}\label{md__2home_2mj_2Desktop_2IoT-Chat-Digitalization_2Dongle_2gnrc__border__router_2README_autotoc_md12}
In order to connect a RIOT 6Lo\+WPAN border router over SLIP you run a small program called tunslip6 (imported from Contiki) \mbox{[}2\mbox{]} on the Linux host. The program can be found in the {\ttfamily dist/tools/tunslip} folder and has to be compiled before first use (simple calling {\ttfamily make} should be enough). Now, one can start the program by calling something like\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd\ dist/tools/tunslip}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ ./tunslip6\ 2001:db8::1/64\ -\/t\ tun0\ -\/s\ /dev/ttyUSB0}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Assuming that {\ttfamily /dev/tty\+USB0} is the device descriptor for the (additional) UART interface of your RIOT board.

On the RIOT side you have to configure the SLIP interface by configuring a corresponding IPv6 address, e.\+g. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ifconfig\ 6\ add\ 2001:db8::2}

\end{DoxyCode}
 and adding the SLIP interface to the neighbor cache (because Linux won\textquotesingle{}t respond to neighbor solicitations on an interface without a link-\/layer address) by calling 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ncache\ add\ 6\ 2001:db8::1}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then, to propagate the prefix you should add an address to the wireless interface\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ifconfig\ 5\ add\ 2001:db8::3}

\end{DoxyCode}


After this you\textquotesingle{}re basically done and should be able to ping between the border router and the outside world (assuming that the Linux host is properly forwarding your traffic).

Additionally, you can configure IPv6 addresses on the 6Lo\+WPAN interface for communication with other 6Lo\+WPAN nodes. See also the {\ttfamily gnrc\+\_\+networking} example for further help.
